# Projeto-CP
University group project about *F-algebra* using **Haskell**.

CP stands for CÃ¡lculo de Programas, literally meaning "Program calculation". 

This subject aspires to teach not to make mistakes when programming and developing software. With different mathematical approaches, we can calculate the program that we want to do, assuring that no mistakes or bugs where made.

This project consists on different types of exercicies that where intended to solve using a *F-algebra* approach.
